# Release policy

## Source of truth

- `main` is the canonical source branch.
- A public release must be traceable to an immutable Git commit/tag.
- Release artifacts must be produced from committed source, never from an uncommitted local working tree.

## Version lineage

Existing project version history, once implementation begins, must be preserved during GitHub migration. Repository bootstrap is not a functional release.

Before HACS publication, the final release/tag format and the integration manifest version format must be validated against current Home Assistant/HACS requirements. Until that validation is complete, no synthetic version number is introduced by this repository scaffold.

## Release gate

Before a release:

1. Repository checks are green.
2. Functional tests for the affected integration behavior are complete.
3. `CHANGELOG.md` is updated.
4. No gateway credentials, private keys, tokens, or private diagnostics are present in tracked files or release artifacts.
5. The release tag points to the exact reviewed commit.

Published tags are treated as immutable.
